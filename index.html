	<p>
		Roliox is an advanced Javascript-based limited sniper & auto-seller for Roblox. It is capable of scanning items up-to 10x faster than other competitors via WebSocket technology.

		<br><br/>To do this, all you need to do is follow the setup instructions below and report any oddities you find by contacting the developer on Discord at <b>{discordContact}</b></a>.

	<h3>Usage</h3>
	<p>Just keep the terminal running in the background and you should start getting snipes within an hour or so.</p>
	<p>We currently do not have a settings panel (soon TM), but everything is pre-configured to the best possible performance.</p>
	<b>It is recommended that you have at-least 500 R$ in your account.</b>
